## Greenhat Industries HQ

This is the digital HQ for Greenhat Industries—a veteran-founded, gear-hungry, adventure-driven media company. Streaming, photography, racing, and whatever else I chase down gets routed through here.

Greenhat Industries exists to turn dreams into business, fund the gear that fuels the journey, and build something real. It's a launchpad, a sandbox, and a signal flare.

## Who’s Running This

A father, a veteran, and a guy who likes to push buttons and see what happens.  
If it looks fun, I probably tried it.  
If it looks hard, I probably had to do it.  
If it’s interactive, I probably designed a media setup around it.
